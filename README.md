## Run the server
1. In terminal, run `redis-server`
1. Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `server` directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run with `npm start`

## Run the client
1. Open another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run with `npm start`

## View the app
1. After running the server and the client, navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## Areas for improvement
These are things I would have included with more time/resources.
1. Better styling using SASS
2. Refactoring server middleware into own folder/files
